# WeatherApp
This is a weather App Made with Flutter thats gets the device's current location and then shows the weather for  that location. 

The user can also be given the option to enter his or her own Location and that location's weather details will show up. 

The power requirements for this app are very low since the location accuracy is set to low; which is about 500m accuracy (more or less about the same extent as a cell tower location)
